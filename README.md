# HMRC Frontend Sandbox

Welcome to the HMRC Frontend Sandbox, this application contains all the required foundations and boiler plate for any HMRC frontend application. It has been created using `scaffolds` an internally developed [templating solution](https://github.com/hmrc/hmrc-frontend-scaffold.g8) that enables Scrum Teams to quickly set up all the required boiler plate to create a new web frontend so that teams can focus on the actual business problem they need to solve.
